OBJECTIVES

Explore the data and tell a visualization story
Compare the stock growth between the companies
Stock price prediction
And time series analysis.
DATA EXPLORATION -
The first thing I did was to explore the data and answer and I answer these questions
If the data is 100 % cleaned
Any blank rows within the 10 datasets
Method of merging the tables to have a consolidated table ( Single table)

Since part of my analysis is time series analysis, then there is a need to extract the year from the date column and if needed month name.

- MERGING OF TABLE
Instead of merging tables on a power query I decided to choose "Append query" You can only append if you have an equal number of columns, since all my tables are in the same column structure hence Append them.

Also extracted the Year column from the date column.

Insights

Total stock volume = $487,344,672,818

The opening stock price = $6,936,442.80

Adjusted closing stock price = $6,919,054.18

The high price of the day = $7,014,537.18

The low price of the day = $6,854,957.13

Other insights

High and low stock prices by companies. From here Amazon is the company with the high and low prices of the day since they are the company engaged with most trading activities during these periods.

The stock price forest shows there is an upward slope from year to year this shows that the adjusted closing stock price of the companies continues to increase on yearly basis.

The comparison of the growth of the companies shows that Amazon is the leading company among the rest despite that they started their trading in the market in 2016 compared to Tesla which was already in the market since 2011.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Amazon has built its reputation on providing excellent customer service and offering a wide range of products at competitive prices. continue to prioritize customer satisfaction to maintain its position as a leading company.

The business world is constantly evolving, and Amazon should continue to innovate and adapt to stay ahead of the competition. The company should invest more in new technologies and explore new markets and opportunities to expand its business.

And Uber which is the lowest company in the market should focus on understanding its customers' needs and finding ways to deliver exceptional experiences that differentiate it from its competitors.

Can expand their services: Uber can consider expanding its services to include new types of transportation, such as bikes or scooters, or offer new services like food delivery, parcel delivery, or other related services.
